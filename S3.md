Simple Storage Service (S3): 

    ➢ S3 is a storage for the internet. It has a simple web service interface for simple 
    storing and retrieving of any amount of data, anytime from anywhere on the 
    internet. 
    ➢ S3 is object based storage. 
    ➢ You cannot install operating system on S3. 
    ➢ S3 has a distributed data store architecture where objects are redundantly stored 
    in multiple locations. (minimum 3 locations in same region) 
    ➢ Data is stored in bucket. 
    ➢ A bucket is a flat container of objects. 
    ➢ Maximum capacity of a bucket is 5TB. 
    ➢ You can create folders in your bucket (available through console) 
    ➢ You cannot create nested buckets. 
    ➢ Bucket ownership is non transferrable. 
    ➢ S3 bucket is region specific. 
    ➢ You can have up to 100 buckets per account. (may expand on request) 

S3 Bucket Naming Rules: 

    ➢ S3 bucket names (keys) are globally unique across all AWS regions. 
    ➢ Bucket names cannot be change after they are created. 
    ➢ If bucket is deleted its name become available again to you or other account to use. 
    ➢ Bucket names must be at least 3 and no more than 63 characters long. 
    ➢ Bucket names are part of URL used to access a bucket. 
    ➢ Bucket name must be a series of one or more labels (xyz bucket) 
    ➢ Bucket names can contain lowercase, numbers and hyphen but cannot use uppercase 
    letters. 
    ➢ Bucket name should not be an IP address. 
    ➢ Each label must start and end with a lowercase letter or a number. 
    ➢ By default buckets and its objects are private, and by default only owner can access the 
    bucket. 

S3 Bucket Sub-Resources: 
Sub-resources of S3 bucket includes: 

    Lifecycle: to decide on objects lifecycle management. 
    Website: to hold configurations related to static website hosted in S3 buckets. 
    Versioning: keep objects versions as it changes (set updated) 
    Access Control List: bucket policies 
    The name is simply two parts: bucket region’s end point / bucket name 
    Example: for S3 bucket named mybucket in Europe west region is 
    https://s3-eu-west1.amazonaws.com/mybucket 
    
  S3 Objects: 
  
    ➢ An object size stored in an S3 bucket can be 0 byte to 5TB. 
    ➢ Each object is stored and retrieve by unique key. (ID or name) 
    ➢ An object in AWS S3 is uniquely identified and addressed through: 
    • service endpoint 
    • bucket name 
    • object key (name) 
    • optionally object version 
    ➢ Object stored in a S3 bucket in a region will never leave that region unless you 
    specifically move them to another region or CRR. 
    ➢ A bucket owner can grant cross account permissions to another AWS account (or users 
    in another account) to upload objects. 
    ➢ You can grant S3 bucket / object permission to: 
    • Individual users 
    • AWS account 
    • Make the resource public 
    • To all authenticate user 

S3 Bucket Versioning: 

    ➢ Bucket versioning is a S3 bucket sub resource used to protect against accidental 
    object/data deletion or overwrites. 
    ➢ Versioning can also be used for data retention and archive. 
    ➢ Once you enable versioning on a bucket it cannot be disabled however it can be 
    suspended. 
    ➢ When enable, bucket versioning will protect existing and new objects and maintains 
    their versions as they are updated. 
    ➢ Updating objects refers to PUT, POST, COPY, DELETE actions on objects. 
    ➢ When versioning is enable and you try to delete an object a delete marker is placed on 
    the object. 
    ➢ You can still view the object and delete the marker. 
    ➢ If you reconsider deleting the objects you can delete the delete marker and the object 
    will be enable again. 
    ➢ You will be charged for all S3 storage cost for all object versions stored. 
    ➢ You can use versioning with S3 lifecycle policies to delete older version or you can 
    move them to a cheaper S3 storage (Glacier.) 
    


STORAGE CLASSES OF AMAZON S3: 

    1. Amazon S3 Standard 
    2. Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive 
    3. Amazon Glacier 
    4. Amazon S3 Standard Infrequent Access 
    5. Amazon S3 one-zone-IA 
    6. Amazon S3 Intelligent Tiering 
    

1. Amazon S3 Standard:
   
        ➢ S3 standard offers high durability, availability and performance object storage 
        for frequently accessed data. 
        ➢ Durability is 99.999999999%. 
        ➢ Designed for 99.99% availability over a given year. 
        ➢ Supports SSL for data in transit and encryption of data at rest. 
        ➢ The storage cost for the object is fairly high but there is very less charge for 
        accessing the objects. 
        ➢ Largest object that can be uploaded in a single PUT in 5GB. 

2. Amazon S3 IA (standard):
   
        ➢ S3-IA is for data that is accessed less frequently but requires rapid access when 
        needed. 
        ➢ The storage cost is much cheaper than S3-standard almost half the price, but 
        you are charged more heavily for accessing your objects. 
        ➢ Durability is 99.999999999%. 
        ➢ Resilient against events that impact an entire AZ. 
        ➢ Availability is 99.9% in a year.

        days. 
        ➢ Backed with the Amazon S3 service level agreement for availability. 

3. Amazon S3 Intelligent Tiering:

        ➢ The S3 intelligent tiering storage class is designed to optimize cost by 
        automatically moving data to the most cost effective access tier. 
        ➢ It works by storing objects in two access tiers. 
        ➢ If an object in the frequent access tier is accessed it is automatically moved back 
        to the frequent access tier. 
        ➢ There is no retrieval fees when using the S3 intelligent tiering storage class and 
        no additional tering fees when objects are moved between access tiers. 
        ➢ Same low latency and high performance of S3 standard. 
        ➢ Objects less than 128kb cannot move to IA. 
        ➢ Durability is99.999999999%. 
        ➢ Availability is 99.9%. 

4. Amazon One-Zone IA

        ➢ It is good choice for storing secondary backup copies of on-premise data of 
        easily re-creatable data. 
        ➢ You can use S3 lifecycle policies. 
        ➢ Durability is 99.999999999%. 
        ➢ Availability is 99.5%. 
        ➢ Because S3 one zone IA stores data in a single AZ, data stored in this storage 
        class will be lost in the event of AZ destruction.
